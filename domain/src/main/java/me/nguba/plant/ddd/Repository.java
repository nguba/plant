/**
 * A repository performs the tasks of an intermediary between the domain model layers and data
 * mapping, acting in a similar way to a set of domain objects in memory.
 * <p>
 * Client objects declaratively build queries and send them to the repositories for answers.
 * Conceptually, a repository encapsulates a set of objects stored in the database and operations
 * that can be performed on them, providing a way that is closer to the persistence layer.
 * <p>
 * Repositories, also, support the purpose of separating, clearly and in one direction, the
 * dependency between the work domain and the data allocation or mapping.
