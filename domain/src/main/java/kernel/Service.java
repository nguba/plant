/**
 * Services model important domain operations that can't find a natural home in an {@link Entity} or
 * {@link ValueObject}.
 * <p>
 * A Service is an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, without
 * encapsulating state (stateless), as {@link Entity} or {@link ValueObject} do.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Services emphasise the relationship with other objects and are defined purely in terms of what
 * they can do for a client. A service tends to be named for an <em>activity</em>, rather than an
 * entity--a verb rather than a noun.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Operation names should come from the <em>Ubiquitous Language</em> or be introduced into it.
 * Parameters and results should be domain objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A good service has the following characteristics
 * <ol>
 * <li>The operation relates to a domain concept that is not a natural part of an {@link Entity} or
 * {@link ValueObject}.
 * <li>The interface is defined in terms of other elements of the domain model.
 * <li>The operation is stateless.
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * When a significant process or transformation in the domain is not a natural responsibility of an
 * ENTITY or VALUE OBJECT, add an operation to the model as standalone interface declared as a
 * SERVICE. Define the interface in terms of the language of the model and make sure the operation
 * name is part of the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE. Make the SERVICE stateless. -Eric Evans.
